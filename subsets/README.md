# Subsets

The following progression of `subsets` implementations demonstrate how state
parameters can make a recursive implementation cleaner or more efficient. View
the files in this order for your understanding:

 * `subsets\_no\_state\_parameters.py`
 * `subsets\_curr\_state\_parameter.py`
 * `subsets\_curr\_idx\_state\_parameters.py`
 * `subsets\_leaf\_aggregation.py`

 All solutions were verified on Leetcode, the coding interview prep site. You can
 experiment on this page: https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/
